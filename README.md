# VirtualSourceModel
Virtual Source Model is an intuitive, non-iterative, forward model to analyze the differential scattering of a dielectric covered conductive ground plane. This simple model is well suited for focused beam, nearfield mm-wave sensing of body-worn explosives for person scanning security systems.
